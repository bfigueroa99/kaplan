\section{Key Concepts: Gerund as Subject}

We often use the Gerund (-ing) as the subject of a sentence. It acts like a noun.

\begin{vocabbox}[title=Gerund Subjects]
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Swimming} is good for you. \trans{Nadar es bueno...}
    \item \textbf{Learning} English takes time. \trans{Aprender inglés...}
    \item \textbf{Smoking} is forbidden here. \trans{Fumar está prohibido...}
\end{itemize}
\end{vocabbox}

\section{Grammar Focus: Meaning Changes}

Some verbs can take both forms, but the meaning changes completely.

\begin{grammarbox}[title=1. Stop]
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stop doing:} Quit an action forever/temporarily.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He \textbf{stopped smoking}. (He doesn't smoke anymore)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stop to do:} Pause one action to do another.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He \textbf{stopped to smoke}. (He paused walking to have a cigarette)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{grammarbox}

\begin{grammarbox}[title=2. Remember]
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Remember doing:} Recall a memory from the past.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I \textbf{remember locking} the door. (I have a memory of it)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Remember to do:} Don't forget to do a task.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Please \textbf{remember to lock} the door. (Don't forget!)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{grammarbox}

\begin{grammarbox}[title=3. Try]
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Try doing:} Experiment with something to see if it works.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Try restarting} your computer. (See if it fixes the problem)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Try to do:} Make an effort to do something difficult.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I \textbf{tried to lift} the box, but it was too heavy.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{grammarbox}

\section{Practice Exercises}

\subsection{Exercise 1: Gerund Subjects}
Complete the sentences with a gerund.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \underline{\hspace{3cm}} (eat) vegetables is healthy.
    \item \underline{\hspace{3cm}} (drive) fast is dangerous.
    \item \underline{\hspace{3cm}} (read) books helps you learn.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise 2: Stop, Remember, Try}
Choose the correct form based on the meaning.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item I stopped (buying / to buy) coffee because it was too expensive.
    \item On my way home, I stopped (buying / to buy) some milk.
    \item Remember (calling / to call) your mother today.
    \item I remember (playing / to play) in this park when I was young.
    \item The window is stuck. Try (pushing / to push) it harder.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise 3: Writing Task}
Write 3 sentences about things you:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stopped doing recently.
    \item Remember doing as a child.
    \item Try to do every day.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white,height=5cm]
% Write here...
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Key Takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gerunds (-ing) can be the subject of a sentence (e.g., \textbf{Running} is fun).
    \item \textbf{Stop + -ing} = Quit. \textbf{Stop + to} = Pause to do something else.
    \item \textbf{Remember + -ing} = Memory. \textbf{Remember + to} = Task.
\end{itemize}


\section{Summary Chart}

This comprehensive chart summarizes the key patterns discussed throughout the chapter, helping you understand which verbs accept gerunds, infinitives, or both.

\subsection{Verbs with Same Meaning (Gerund or Infinitive)}

When these verbs are followed by either a gerund or infinitive, the meaning remains essentially the same:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5, colframe=blue!30, title=Same Meaning Pattern]
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Recommend + Gerund/Infinitive}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I recommend \textbf{studying} English daily. (or: I recommend \textbf{to study} English daily.)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Avoid + Gerund} (Note: avoid typically takes gerund only)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You should avoid \textbf{eating} too much sugar.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Want + Infinitive} (Note: want typically takes infinitive only)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I want \textbf{to learn} French next year.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Love + Both Gerund and Infinitive} (Both are correct)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item She loves \textbf{swimming}. / She loves \textbf{to swim}.
        \item I love \textbf{reading} novels. / I love \textbf{to read} novels.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
