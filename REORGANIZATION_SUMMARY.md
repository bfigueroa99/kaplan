- **After**: Dedicated Prepositions chapter (Ch 9) with comprehensive coverage

### 4. Advanced Grammar Grouped
- **Before**: Advanced topics mixed with basics
- **After**: Advanced grammar in dedicated Part VIII (Passive, Conditionals, Reported Speech)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Review Chapter 23 (Cultural Traditions) - remove any passive voice content now in Chapter 18
2. Review Chapter 25 (Travel) - verify preposition content is properly distributed with Chapter 09

### Future Improvements
1. Consider adding more practice exercises to foundation chapters (1-3)
2. Add cross-references between related topics (e.g., Ch 2 Past Simple → Ch 15 Past Experiences)
3. Create summary tables at end of each Part showing progression
4. Add diagnostic tests at start of each Part to assess readiness
