\begin{itemize}
    \item Zero Conditional: General truths
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If + present simple, present simple
        \item Example: If you heat water, it boils.
    \end{itemize}
    \item First Conditional: Real future possibilities
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If + present simple, will + base verb
        \item Example: If it rains, we will stay inside.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Second Conditional: Unreal present/future situations
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If + past simple, would + base verb
        \item Example: If I were rich, I would travel the world.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Third Conditional: Unreal past situations
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If + past perfect, would have + past participle

\section{2nd conditional vs 3rd conditional vs mixed conditionals}

\subsection{What makes these different?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 2nd Conditional: Unreal present/future situations
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If + past simple, would + base verb
        \item Example: If I were rich, I would travel the world.
    \end{itemize}
    \item 3rd Conditional: Unreal past situations
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If + past perfect, would have + past participle
        \item Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Mixed Conditionals: Present result of a past condition
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If + past perfect, would + base verb
        \item Example: If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


To differentiate between these conditionals, focus on the time frame of the condition and the result. The 2nd conditional deals with present or future unreal situations, the 3rd conditional addresses past unreal situations, and mixed conditionals connect a past condition to a present result.
