Writing 2

I live in a student castle, where is located in Oxford. My room in this accommodation is small but cozy, which has a bed, a desk, and a little toilet. About where I keep my things, I have a wardrobe, where I hang my clothes and store my shoes. There is also a shelf near of my desk, which I use to keep some things like folder and other things. On the wall there is board to pin some notes and photos. Somethings I listen music from neigbor, who is practice saxofone, and is really relax to hear. The only problem with my room is the windows, which are do not open well, and the other problem is my heigth, I am very tall, and some time I hit my head with the shower.
