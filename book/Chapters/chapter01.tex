\section{Reading Context}
\begin{readingbox}[title=Dialogue: A Typical Day vs. Right Now]
\textbf{Emma:} Hi Tom! What are you doing?\\
\textbf{Tom:} I\textbf{'m reading} a book about business. What about you?\\
\textbf{Emma:} I usually \textbf{work} in the office, but today I\textbf{'m working} from home.\\

\textbf{Emma:} Yes, I do. I \textbf{prefer} it because I \textbf{don't spend} time commuting.\\
\textbf{Tom:} I \textbf{understand}. The kids \textbf{are playing} outside right now, so it's quiet.\\

\section{Grammar Focus: Present Simple}

The Present Simple describes \textbf{routines, habits, facts, and general truths}.

\begin{grammarbox}[title=Present Simple Structure]
\textbf{Affirmative:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I/You/We/They + \textbf{verb} (base form)
    \item He/She/It + \textbf{verb + s/es}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Negative:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I/You/We/They + \textbf{don't} + verb
    \item He/She/It + \textbf{doesn't} + verb
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Questions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Do} + I/you/we/they + verb?
    \item \textbf{Does} + he/she/it + verb?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I \textbf{work} in an office. \trans{Trabajo en una oficina}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
  % Timeline
  \draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (12,0) node[right] {\textbf{Time}};
  
  % Present Simple - repeated actions
  \foreach \x in {2,4,6,8,10} {
    \draw[blue, very thick] (\x,-0.3) -- (\x,0.3);
  }
  \node[blue] at (6,-1) {\textbf{Present Simple}};
  \node[blue, align=center] at (6,-1.5) {Repeated actions\\every day/week/month};
  
  % Present Continuous - happening now

  \draw[black, very thick] (10,-0.5) -- (10,0.5);
  \node[black] at (10,-0.8) {NOW};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{notebox}[title=💡 Quick Decision Guide]
Ask yourself: \textbf{Is it happening RIGHT NOW or is it a ROUTINE?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Right now, at this moment → \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Present Continuous}}
    \item Every day, usually, always → \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Present Simple}}
\end{itemize}
\end{notebox}
