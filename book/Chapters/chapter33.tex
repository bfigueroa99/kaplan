\section{Reading Context}

\begin{readingbox}[title=Personal Anecdote Example]
I remember when I first moved to London. I was nervous about taking the underground. On my first day, I got on the wrong train by mistake. The doors closed before I could exit, and I was stuck with no idea where I was going! A kind elderly woman noticed my confused expression and helped me understand where I was. I got off at the next stop, laughed at myself, and finally made it to my destination. That experience taught me to always ask for help when I need it.
