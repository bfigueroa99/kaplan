\section{Reading Context}
\begin{readingbox}[title=Dialogue: Childhood Memories]
\textbf{Grandpa:} This photo brings back memories. I \textbf{used to} live in a small village.\\
\textbf{Grandson:} Really? What was it like?\\
\textbf{Grandpa:} It was quiet. We didn't have TV. Every evening, my father \textbf{would} tell us stories.\\
\textbf{Grandson:} That sounds nice. Did you play video games?\\
\textbf{Grandpa:} No! We \textbf{used to} play outside all day. In the summer, we \textbf{would} go swimming in the river.\\
\textbf{Grandson:} I \textbf{used to} be afraid of swimming.\\
\textbf{Grandpa:} Me too, at first. But I loved it later.

\section{Key Concepts: Past Habits}

We use two structures to talk about things we did in the past but don't do now.

\begin{vocabbox}[title=Used To vs. Would]
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Used to + Verb:} For past habits AND states.
    \item \textbf{Would + Verb:} ONLY for past repeated actions.
\end{itemize}
\end{vocabbox}

\section{Grammar Focus: The Rules}

\begin{grammarbox}[title=Rule 1: Action Verbs]
For repeated actions (play, go, visit, eat), you can use both:
\begin{itemize}
    \item I \textbf{used to} play football. \checkmark
    \item I \textbf{would} play football. \checkmark
\end{itemize}
\end{grammarbox}

\begin{grammarbox}[title=Rule 2: Stative Verbs]
For states (be, have, live, love, know), use ONLY \textbf{used to}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item I \textbf{used to} be shy. \checkmark
    \item I \textbf{would} be shy. \textbf{X} (Incorrect)
    \item I \textbf{used to} have a car. \checkmark
    \item I \textbf{would} have a car. \textbf{X} (Incorrect)
\end{itemize}
\end{grammarbox}

\subsection{Exercise 2: Fill in the Blanks}

\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Key Takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Used to} works for everything (habits and states).
    \item \textbf{Would} only works for actions (running, playing), not states (being, having).
    \item Negative: \textbf{didn't use to} (no 'd').
    \item Question: \textbf{Did you use to...?}
\end{itemize}
