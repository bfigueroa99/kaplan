What do you wish were different going into 2026? why?

I wish I had started doing new things, for example improve my coding skills and improve my English skills.

I also wish I had traveled more and explored new places and cultures.

I wish I had taken better care of my health and fitness.

I wish I had spent more quality time with my family.

I wish I had been more organized and managed my time better.
