% Introduce current condition of accommodation

In this accommodation, there are several issues that need to be addressed. The sofa is torn and damaged, making it uncomfortable to sit on. The floor is dirty and stained, which detracts from the overall cleanliness of the room. Additionally, the carpet is poorly maintained and requires thorough cleaning. The walls have several deep cracks that need to be repaired to prevent further damage. There is also a water leak that needs immediate attention to avoid potential flooding. The table is dirty and needs to be cleaned, while the exposed pipes on the ceiling give the room an unfinished look. Lastly, the pillows are worn out and should be replaced for better comfort.


% Propose solutions using "have something done" structure

To improve the living conditions in this accommodation, I plan to have several repairs and maintenance tasks completed. I will have the sofa restored to fix the tears and damage, making it comfortable again. The floor will be cleaned to remove stains and improve its appearance. I will also have the carpet professionally cleaned to ensure it is hygienic and well-maintained. The deep cracks in the walls will be repaired to prevent further deterioration. The water leak will be fixed promptly to avoid any potential flooding issues. I will have the table cleaned to enhance its usability, and the exposed pipes on the ceiling will be covered to give the room a more polished look. Finally, I will have new pillows replaced to ensure comfort during my stay. I will have new plants added to the room, I will have windows installed in the left wall, and I will have a new wardrobe added to the kitchen area to improve storage space. I have to change the floor for a wooden one. In the kitche I have to swap the table and chairs for a new set. I have to installed a new refrigarator and oven in the kitchen area. The color of the walls need to be changed to a whiter tone to make the room look brighter.
